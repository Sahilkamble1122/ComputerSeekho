## üîß **Configuration Changes**

### **application.properties Updates:**
```properties
# Enable database initialization with data.sql
spring.sql.init.mode=always
spring.sql.init.data-locations=classpath:data.sql
spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
```

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **1. Database Initialization:**
- The dummy data will be automatically loaded when the application starts
- Data is inserted after the database schema is created
- All relationships between tables are properly maintained

### **2. Testing the API:**
Once the application starts, you can test the endpoints with the dummy data:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/test/health

# Get all students
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students

# Get all courses
curl http://localhost:8080/api/courses

# Get all enquiries
curl http://localhost:8080/api/enquiries

# Search students by name
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students/search/name/Rahul

# Get students by course
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students/course/1

# Get pending enquiries
curl http://localhost:8080/api/enquiries/pending
```

### **3. Data Relationships:**
- **Students** are enrolled in **Courses** and assigned to **Batches**
- **Enquiries** are linked to **Follow-ups** and **Closure Reasons**
- **Payments** are linked to **Students**, **Courses**, and **Payment Types**
- **Placements** are linked to **Students**
- **Images** and **Videos** are categorized by type
- **Albums** contain collections of related content

## üìà **Data Statistics**

| Table | Records | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Course Master | 8 | Available courses |
| Staff Master | 8 | Teaching and non-teaching staff |
| Batch Master | 8 | Course batches with timings |
| Student Master | 16 | Enrolled students |

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of Dummy Data**

1. **Realistic Testing**: Test all API endpoints with realistic data
2. **Relationship Testing**: Verify foreign key relationships work correctly
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with meaningful data volumes
4. **UI Development**: Frontend developers can work with real data
5. **Documentation**: Provides examples of expected data formats
6. **Training**: Helps understand the system structure

## üîÑ **Data Refresh**

To refresh the dummy data:
1. Stop the application
2. Clear the database tables (if needed)
3. Restart the application
4. Data will be automatically re-inserted

The dummy data provides a comprehensive foundation for testing and developing your educational institution management system!
